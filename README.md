Please test this firmware and let us know if it misbehaves in any way. Volunteers are standing by!

## Marlin 1.0.2-3

This branch contains the latest tagged version of Marlin 1.0.x (1.0.2-3 â€“ June 2022). Marlin 1.0.1 was the previous minor release tag (December 2014), and then any version of Marlin before we started tagging versions can be called Marlin 1.0.0.

## Patches - 1.1.x Branch

Although we are focused on Marlin 2.x, patches to fix bugs or make improvements to Marlin 1.1.x are still welcome! Patches should be submitted to the [Marlin 1.1.x bugfix](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/bugfix-1.1.x) branch, which we use for review and testing. Any patches under testing for Marlin 1.1.x will be found in the [bugfix-1.1.x branch](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/tree/bugfix-1.0.x).

## Marlin 2.x

Marlin version 2 continues to support 8-bit AVR boards while adding support for 32-bit ARM. With several years of improvements, Marlin 2 is the best choice for old and new printers alike! It supports many more axes, extruders, and a wider variety of modern peripherals. Check the Issues and Pull Requests links on the right to to see what we are currently working on before submitting a new report.

Download earlier versions of Marlin on the [Releases page](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/releases).

## Example Configurations

Before building Marlin you'll need to configure it for your specific hardware. Your vendor should have already provided source code with configurations for the installed firmware, but if you ever decide to upgrade you'll need updated configuration files. Marlin users have contributed dozens of tested example configurations to get you started. Visit the [MarlinFirmware/Configurations](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Configurations) repository to find the right configuration for your hardware.

## Building Marlin 1.0.x

To build Marlin 1.0.x you'll need a compatible version of [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software). Detailed build and install instructions are posted at:

  - [Installing Marlin (Arduino)](http://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_arduino.html)

## Contributors

Marlin is constantly improving thanks to a huge number of contributors from all over the world bringing their specialties and talents. Huge thanks are due to [all the contributors](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/graphs/contributors) who regularly patch up bugs, help direct traffic, and basically keep Marlin from falling apart. Marlin's continued existence would not be possible without them.

## Administration

Regular users can open and close their own issues, but only the administrators can do project-related things like add labels, merge changes, set milestones, and kick trolls. The current Marlin admin team consists of:

## License

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](/COPYING.md) because we believe in open development. The GPL comes with both rights and obligations. Whether you use Marlin firmware as the driver for your open or closed-source product, you must keep Marlin open, and you must provide your compatible Marlin source code to end users upon request. The most straightforward way to comply with the Marlin license is to make a fork of Marlin on Github, perform your modifications, and direct users to your modified fork.

While we can't prevent the use of this code in products (3D printers, CNC, etc.) that are closed source or crippled by a patent, we would prefer that you choose another firmware or, better yet, make your own.
